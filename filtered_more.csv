agni or the “digestive fire,” is one of the most important principles in the ancient science of ayurveda. it refers broadly to our ability to process all aspects of life, including food, experiences, memories, and sensory impressions. agni is responsible for absorbing the nutrients and essential elements the body needs while burning off waste products (agni is the root of the english word “ignite”).

if our agni is strong, we’re able to digest food efficiently and easily assimilate our daily experiences. on the other hand, if agni is weak, our body won’t digest well, creating toxic residue or ama that lodges deep in our cells.

according to ayurvedic teaching, strong agni leads to excellent health and well-being, while the accumulation of ama results in the slow deterioration of the body and ultimately, disease. the inability to metabolize emotions produces just as much toxic residue as undigested food. in fact, pent-up anger, long-held sadness, and lingering guilt are more debilitating for most people than problems with physical digestion.

tip: 1. it is essential for the cooked rice to be loose-grained. either pre-wash the rice in cold water to remove the free starch or allow cooked rice to cool to room temperature and then fluff with two-pronged fork. attempting the latter with unwashed warm rice will result in a sticky mush. cooking time does not include cooking the rice as this step can be done in advance.

2. a non-stick or seasoned carbon steel wok is most suitable for stir-frying rice.

variations: 1. replace the asparagus with chopped mushrooms, fresh peppers, bacon, ham, canned tuna or any other ingredient, or any combination. also add scrambled raw egg to the rice while constantly stirring in final stages of frying for added flavour.

2. replace red onion with white, green or spring, or shallots as and when available.

3. spiciness is varied by adding more or less crushed chillies and using fresh green or red chillies add to colour.

4. rice can be cooked in any stock of your choice, or add two teaspoonsful of any soup powder mix to the water in which the rice is cooked to achieve subtle variations in taste.","['cooked rice', 'chicken stock', 'asparagus spear', 'red onion', 'garlic clove', 'red chile', 'salt & pepper', 'butter']",8

ive added a few ingredients, these are the fennel seeds, tandoori masala, and the addition of onions in the first stage.

you can vary the spice levels within this recipe; i think the quantities i have added would make this hot - very hot if you are not used to curries. say perhaps a madras level. if you are reducing the spice, make sure you reduce the turmeric accordingly too.

i have written 1/2 cup butter/oil/ghee but i prefer to use a combination of butter and oil.  also, i do not add salt as it is usually contained in the baked bean cans.
